`Fix my code` is a new type of project, where weâ€™ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!

Sometimes you will know the language, sometimes not.

Please download the repository [0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/rq-j1VNUKRTQoADfDRXJmg) and use it as initial files for all solutions.

You should not recode everything, just fix it!
